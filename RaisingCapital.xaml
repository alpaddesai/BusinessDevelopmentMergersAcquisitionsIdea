This would establish the acquiring company as the sole share holder with the target company be a subsidiary. The second step would be once the target company is the majority shareholder, through a back end merger it can require the minority shareholders to sell any remaining stock if required. To finance the purchase the acquiring company would borrow $1888.54 million through public corporate bonds.
