                    <Run Text="With that said, let me go through a high level merger analysis with financial statements from 2017, based on a custom idea from a few years ago for one of my MBA projects. This custom idea was to incorporate the Ansys design toolkits within Synopsys and hence remove overlapping products, markets and customers. The operational, financial and market synergies would justify the investment and the combined product portfolio would enable customers especially architects to transition seamlessly through the product portfolio.  The details of the market research project is not provided. A custom NPV analysis based on custom spreadsheets is provided along with an executive level summary of the synergies, sort of a back of a napkin quick analysis, assuming a sales growth ratio of 12% with a long term growth ratio of 4.5% and an beta value of approximately 0.9 with generic treasury bond yield values for long term and short term debt a custom DCF analysis values the current market value of the firm to be $12.892billion with 150.47 million outstanding shares with a value of $85.68price of share. The standalone entity valuation for Ansys with a  long term growth rate of 7%, beta value of 0.9 and projected sales growth ratio of 15% to be approximately $13.851billion with a stock price value of $131.02 at the end of the year. Analyst predictions for next year sales are higher than 15% hence the current market price of the stock is $186.54. "/>

                    <Run Text="The estimated valuation of the combined firm is $55.293 billion with an NPV of tax shields equating to $9.084 billion The capital structure of the combined firm would be optimized with a 23% ratio of debt to entity. With operational synergies of $5.459 billion and marketing synergies of $8.177 billion, the valuation including synergies would equate to a stock price of $269.06. The financial synergy would be more stable cash flows and lower beta value. Due to the high growth product portfolio of Ansys, the long term growth rate of the combined firm would be higher than Synopsys standalone.    Knowledge on the industry would be very helpful in understanding the details on why these are the synergy values and what further optimizations are possible. Alternative scenarios besides acquiring debt to raise capital to finance the merger would also be areas of further optimization for this analysis.  "/>
